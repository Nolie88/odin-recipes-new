    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baklava is a rich, sweet dessert pastry made of layers of filo filled with chopped nuts and sweetened with syrup or honey. It's a popular dessert in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines.</p>
    <p>This recipe features a delicious mixture of walnuts and pistachios layered between crispy sheets of phyllo dough, all soaked in a fragrant honey syrup. Perfect for special occasions or as a delightful treat.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package phyllo dough</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped pistachios</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees Celsius (350 degrees Fahrenheit). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix together the chopped walnuts, pistachios, and cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Unroll the phyllo dough and cut it to fit the baking dish. Cover the phyllo with a damp cloth to keep it from drying out as you work.</li>
        <li>Place two sheets of phyllo in the bottom of the prepared baking dish and brush with melted butter. Repeat this process until you have 8 sheets layered.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a thin layer of the nut mixture over the phyllo. Add two more sheets of phyllo, butter them, and sprinkle with nuts. Continue layering until all the nuts are used. Top with 8 sheets of buttered phyllo, making sure to butter the top layer.</li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife, cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the phyllo is golden and crisp, about 50 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the baklava is baking, make the syrup. In a saucepan, combine the sugar and water over medium heat and bring to a boil. Stir in the honey, vanilla extract, and lemon zest. Reduce heat and simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the baklava from the oven and immediately pour the syrup over it. Let cool completely before serving.</li>
    </ol>
