    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggplants, sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>500g ground beef or lamb</li>
        <li>1 can (400g) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup red wine</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius (400 degrees Fahrenheit). Lightly oil a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Arrange the eggplant slices on the baking sheet, brush with olive oil, and bake until tender and golden, about 20 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the remaining olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef or lamb, and cook until browned. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, red wine, cinnamon, allspice, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 20 minutes. Stir in the parsley and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook for 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in the milk and cook until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the egg yolks and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Reduce oven temperature to 175 degrees Celsius (350 degrees Fahrenheit). In a greased 9x13 inch baking dish, layer half of the eggplant slices, followed by the meat mixture, and then the remaining eggplant slices. Pour the béchamel sauce over the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling, about 45 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
