    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spanakopita is a traditional Greek savory pastry filled with spinach, feta cheese, and various herbs. This dish is known for its crispy, flaky layers of phyllo dough and rich, flavorful filling. It's perfect as an appetizer, side dish, or even a main course for a light meal.</p>
    <p>This recipe brings together the vibrant flavors of fresh spinach and the tangy creaminess of feta, wrapped in golden, buttery phyllo. Spanakopita is not only delicious but also visually appealing, making it a great addition to any meal or gathering.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 pounds spinach, rinsed and chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound phyllo dough</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees Celsius (350 degrees Fahrenheit).</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the green onions and garlic, and cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the spinach and parsley to the skillet and cook until the spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the eggs, feta cheese, ricotta cheese, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Stir in the cooled spinach mixture until well combined.</li>
        <li>Lay one sheet of phyllo dough in a greased 9x13 inch baking dish, and brush with melted butter. Lay another sheet of phyllo dough on top, and brush with butter. Repeat this process with six more sheets of phyllo dough, brushing each sheet with butter before adding the next.</li>
        <li>Spread the spinach and cheese mixture evenly over the phyllo dough in the baking dish. Layer the remaining sheets of phyllo dough on top, brushing each sheet with melted butter, just as before.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the phyllo is golden brown and crisp, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before cutting into squares and serving.</li>
    </ol>
